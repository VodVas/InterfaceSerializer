InterfaceSerializer for Unity
Description
InterfaceSerializer is a lightweight Unity editor tool that enables serialization of interface references in the Inspector. It solves the common Unity limitation where interfaces cannot be directly assigned in the Editor.

Key Features
🛠️ Universal Interface Support - Works with any C# interface

🔍 Type-Safe Validation - Prevents incorrect assignments

⚡ Zero Runtime Overhead - All processing happens in Editor

📦 UPM-Compatible - Easy installation via Git URL

Installation
Add to your project via Unity Package Manager:

Open Window > Package Manager

Click + > Add package from Git URL

Paste:
[https://github.com/your-username/InterfaceSerializer.git?path=/Assets/Plugins/InterfaceSerializer](https://github.com/VodVas/InterfaceSerializer/edit/main/README.md)

Usage
Create your interface:

csharp
public interface IDamageable { void TakeDamage(float amount); }
Implement in MonoBehaviour:

csharp
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour, IDamageable { ... }
Reference in other components:

csharp
[SerializeField, InterfaceConstraint(typeof(IDamageable))] 
private MonoBehaviour _damageable;

// Access the interface
private IDamageable Damageable => _damageable as IDamageable;
